# Space Quest III - The Undiscovered Country Road - Extended Planets Pack!

## What is this? 

A mod for the DOS version of Space Quest III. It add several new planets and features to explore while leaving the base game mostly intact. It is currently under development and unfinished in several places. 

Notice: Due to SCI0 memory limitations this mod can be used with in ScummVM only. DOSBox and retro hardware will crash with heap errors. It's unfortunate, but I believe the freedom to implement complex new features outweighs DOSBox compatibility for this project. 

## New features

New features has moved to <a href="https://github.com/Doomlazer/SQ3-TUCR-EPP/wiki">the wiki</a> due to mild spoilers.

## Installation

This mod requires the retail version of SQ3. Both the GOG and Steam versions are compatible, but SQ3 version 1.018 is required.

Copy the "patch" folder into your SQ3 game folder. Launch using ScummVM as normal.

Remove the "patch" folder to uninstall.

## I'm trying to test some of the new features, how can I skip the opening sequence?

When Roger wakes up and exits the escape pod, type <b>PUMP SHARK</b> to activate debugging. 

You can use the debug command <b>TP</b> to teleport to other rooms, but it's best to type <b>QA</b> in the first room, then select the "space" option which makes the Mallard spaceworthy and ready to warp to any planet. 

FYI, the QA debug command is only available in the first room. More debugging info <a href="http://sciwiki.sierrahelp.com//index.php?title=SCI_Debug_Modes#Space_Quest_3">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Doomlazer/SCI-Debug-Resources">here</a>.
