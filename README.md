## INSTALLATION

This mod requires the retail version of SQ3. Both the GOG and Steam versions are compatible. This mod has only been tested with SQ3 version 1.018. Savegames are not compatible with vanilla SQ3.

To download the patch, click the green "CODE" button near the top of this page and select "Download Zip". Uncompress the .zip and find the PATCHES folder.

DOSBox users <b>must copy the contents</b> of PATCHES into the SQ3 game folder. All the mod files need to be loose inside the folder next to SQ3.bat - this makes uninstalling the mod difficult, so it's recommend you back up your SQ3 game folder or use a copy of SQ3 for this mod.

ScummVM users can move the entire PATCHES folder into the SQ3 game folder. Remove the PATCHES folder to uninstall.

## New feature

### Decoder Ring

<img src="pics/ring.png"  width="600" alt="Monolth Burger Decoder ring changes.">

The Monolth Buger Decoder ring is now a fully functional ceasar cipher. Rotating the dial on the ring changes the letter offset on the ring. It also shows the standard english letters on the videogame screen - however scrambled they might be.

### Personal Time Disruptor

This new inventory item can temporarily freeze a copy of Roger in time, this will be used for some future puzzles and can also be used to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czkSgwzEfqA">cheat death</a>. This has not been fully tested against all deaths yet, please report bugs.

## I'm trying to test a planet, how can I skip the opening sequence?

When Roger wakes up and exits the escape pod, type <b>PUMP SHARK</b> to activate debugging. 

You can use the debug command <b>TP</b> to teleport to other rooms, but it's best to type <b>QA</b> in the first room, then select the "space" option which makes the Mallard spaceworthy and ready to warp to any planet. 

FYI, the QA debug command is only available in the first room. More debugging info <a href="http://sciwiki.sierrahelp.com//index.php?title=SCI_Debug_Modes#Space_Quest_3">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Doomlazer/SCI-Debug-Resources">here</a>.
