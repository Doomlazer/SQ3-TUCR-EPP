# Space Quest III - The Undiscovered Country Road - Extended Planets Pack!

## INSTALLATION

DOSBox users must copy the contents of PATCHES into the SQ3 game folder. ScummVM users can copy either the contents or the entire PATCHES folder into the SQ3 game folder.

## What is this?

A mod for the DOS version of Space Quest III. It adds new planets to the Aluminum Malard's scanner. Currently there are two new planets appearing in sectors 23 and 27. They are both proof of concept for now.

## Why am I getting so many popup ads during the game?

Unfortunately, the SQ3-TUCR-EPP mod was developed as adware. You can pay 20 buckazoids to remove all advertisements from the game or:

  <summary>(click arrow to reveal spoiler)</summary>
   Use the reverse command "MAGIC PAY" to disable ads immediately without payment.
</details>

## I have an idea for a planet

New planet submissions are engouraged, though limited by HEAP memory in some scripts. I'm not sure what that number is right now. I don't think ScummVM cares about exeeding the HEAP, but ideally DOSBox should be supported as well. A tutorial covering what is needed to add a new planet is coming, but the source code for scripts in the PATCHES folder can be referenced in the meantime. 

To get started download SCICompanion from https://github.com/Kawa-oneechan/SCICompanion or http://scicompanion.com/download/. Move the 'src' folder and game.ini into a backed up copy of your SQ3 folder, then open resource.map from within SCICompanion.
